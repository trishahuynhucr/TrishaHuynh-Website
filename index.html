        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Trisha huynh. I am a freshman attending the University of California, RIverside. I am an English major. In the future I would like to work as a Lawyer under a popular and well known law firm. My favorite colors are beige, green, and blue. I have three siblings and I am the only daughter in my family. I was born and raised in Southern California in Orange County. I like wearing backpacks all the time. My favorite one is my shark backpack. I enjoy listening to music in my room and going for late night drives. I used to be very social growing up. I would go up to people and spark random conversations and in the end I would have a new friend. Once Covid-19 hit, I became very anti-social, and quite frankly very afraid to talk to people. Once I feel comfortable though, it makes it much easier for me to open up. My name is Trisha huynh. I am a freshman attending the University of California, RIverside. I am an English major.

Once I feel comfortable though, it makes it much easier for me to open up. I enjoy going to the gym. I go to the gym five to six times a week and my favorite muscle group to hit is shoulders. I used to take pre-workout, but I do not like the one I currently have. I am on the lookout for a new one. I’ve enjoyed my first year of college thus far. My favorite class I’ve taken so far is my public policy class. I enjoyed the material and the professor made the material easy to understand. I am looking forward to the rest of my years at UCR. Next year I will be living in a house–not far from campus–with a few of my closest friends from school. I am very excited to have my very own place for the first time. We want to host little get togethers with all of our friends. There is also a pool and playground in the community, so it would be a great place for people to come together. My family is very excited to come over as well. I just know my family will love my housemates. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me!
